    That’s why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit
         D7                       Gm
    I’m travelling at the speed of light

    I’m a rocket ship on my way to Mars, on a collision course
          Gm              C
    I’m a satellite, I’m out of control
           F         	      Am             Dm

    About to oh oh oh explode

          F7                 Bb            Gm
    I’m burning through the sky yeah, two hundred degrees

    That’s why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit
         D7                         Gm
    I’m travelling at the speed of light
