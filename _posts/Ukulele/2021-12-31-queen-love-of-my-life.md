       C                 Am
    Love of my life, you've hurt me
          Dm                    G
    You've broken my heart and now you leave me
        C                   F
    Love of my life, can't you see?
        Dm            Am
    Bring it back, bring it back
        Bb             F
    Don't take it away from me
        Bb    Am   Dm  G               C      F
    Because you don't know what it means to me
    
    
       C                    Am
    Love of my life, don't leave me
          Dm                  G
    You taken my love you now desert me
         C                     F
    Love of my life can't you see?
        Dm                 Am
    Bring it back, bring it back
      Bb           A
    Don't take it away from me
      Bb      Am   Dm   G             C      F
    Because you don't know what it means to me
    
    
       Dm                 Am
    You will remember when this is flown over
       Bb                          F
    And everything's all by the way
       Dm                 Am                   Gb   
    When I grow older I will be there at your side
                          Gm
    To remind you how I still love you
           C7
    I still love you
    
    
       Dm        Am
    Back, hurry back
       Bb           F
    Please bring it back home to me
     Bb         Am     Dm      G       C    F
    Because you don't know what it means to me
     Dm
    Love of my life
     Am                     
    Love of my life         
      Bb     Bbm          F
    hu.. hu.. yeah yeah yeah
