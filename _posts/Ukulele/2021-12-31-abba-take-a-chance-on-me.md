    If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
                                           G
    Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
    
    If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
                                            C
    If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
    
    
                   C
    If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
                                           G
    Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
                                 
    Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
                                      C
    If you put me to the test, if you let me try
    
    
           Dm        G
    Take a chance on me
           Dm        G
    Take a chance on me
    
    
    Dm
    We can go dancing, we can go walking
       C
    As long as we're together
    Dm
    Listen to some music, maybe just talking
    C
    Get to know you better
    
    
                             Am                      
    'Cause you know I've got so much that I wanna do
    F                                     Am  F  G
    When I dream I'm alone with you, it's magic
    Am                              F
    You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
                Dm      G         Dm          G
    But I think you know - that I can't let go
    
    
                       C
    If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
                                           G
    Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
    
    If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
                                            C
    If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
    
    If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
    
    
                                           G
    Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
                                 
    Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
                                      C
    If you put me to the test, if you let me try
           Dm        G
    Take a chance on me
           Dm        G
    Take a chance on me
    
    
               Dm
    Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry
    C
    Know I'm gonna get you
    Dm                     
    You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry
    C
    I ain't gonna let you
    
    
                         Am
    Let me tell you now, my love is strong enough
    F                                   Am   F G
    To last when things are rough, it's magic
    Am                            F
    You say that I waste my time, but I can't get you off my mind
         Dm           G          Dm          G
    No I can't let go - 'cause I love you so
    
    
                       C
    If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
                                           G
    Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
    
    If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
                                            C
    If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
    
    If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
                                           G
    Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
                                 
    Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
                                      C
    If you put me to the test, if you let me try
    
    
           Dm        G
    Take a chance on me
           Dm        G
    Take a chance on me
    
    
                C
    Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, ba-ba-ba-ba ba
                                           G
    Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
                                 
    Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
                                     C
    Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
