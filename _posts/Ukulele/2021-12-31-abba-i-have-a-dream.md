    Intro:
        A G D A7
        A G D
    
    D        A7               D
    I have a dream, a song to sing
               A7            D
    To help me cope, with anything
                   A      A7          D
    If you see the wonder, of a fairy tale
                     A     A7            D
    You can take the future, even if you fail
    
    
                 A7
    I believe in angels;
                      G            D
    something good in everything I see
                 A7              
    I believe in angels;
                    G                 D
    when I know the time is right for me
                   A7               D
    I ll cross the stream, I have a dream
    
    
    D        A7            D
    I have a dream, a fantasy
               A7            D
    To help me through, reality
                A     A7                   D
    And my destination, makes it worth the while
                        A       A7              D
    Pushing through the darkness, still another mile
    
    
                 A7
    I believe in angels;
                      G            D
    something good in everything I see
                 A7              
    I believe in angels;
                    G                 D
    when I know the time is right for me
                   A7                D
    I ll cross the stream - I have a dream
                   A7                D
    I ll cross the stream - I have a dream
