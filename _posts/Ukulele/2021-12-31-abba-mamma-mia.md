    Intro: D D D D x2
    
    D         A          D                       G
    I've been cheated by you, since I don't know when
    D    A          D                        G
    So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
    D               D   
    Look at me now, will I ever learn?
    D              D                 G
    I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
                       A
    There's a fire within my soul
    G    D     A
    Just one   look and I can hear a bell ring
    G   D    A
    One more look and I forget everything,
    
    Chorus:
    D                          
    Mamma mia, here I go again
    C   G               D  
    My  my, how can I resist you?
    D
    Mamma mia, does it show again?
    C   G                      D  
    My  my, just how much I've missed you
    
    D              A   
    Yes, I've been brokenhearted
    Bm             Gbm  
    Blue since the day we parted
    C    G   Em         A
    Why, why did I ever let you go?
    D         Bm 
    Mamma mia, now I really know,
    C    G   Em            A           
    My   my, I could never let you go.
    
    Interlude: D D D D   
     
    D         A         D                             G
    I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
    D       A             D                              G
    I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
    D               D   
    And when you go, when you slam the door
    D              D                     G
    I think you know, that you won't be away too long
                      A
    You know that I'm not that strong.
    G    D     A
    Just one   look and I can hear a bell ring
    G   D    A
    One more look and I forget everything,
    
    D                          
    Mamma mia, here I go again
    C   G               D  
    My  my, how can I resist you?
    D
    Mamma mia, does it show again?
    C   G                      D  
    My  my, just how much I've missed you
    D              A   
    Yes, I've been brokenhearted
    Bm             Gbm  
    Blue since the day we parted
    C    G   Em         A
    Why, why did I ever let you go?
    
    D
    Mamma mia, even if I say
    C   G                    D  
    Bye bye, leave me now or never
    D
    mamma mia, it's a game we play
    C   G                   D  
    Bye bye doesn't mean forever
    
    Chorus:
    D                          
    Mamma mia, here I go again
    C   G               D  
    My  my, how can I resist you?
    D
    Mamma mia, does it show again?
    C   G                      D  
    My  my, just how much I've missed you
