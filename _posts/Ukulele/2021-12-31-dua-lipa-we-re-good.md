Intro: Am D
     
    Verse 1:
    -nc-        Am
    I'm on an island,
    D                 Am
     Even when you're close
    D                Am
     Can't take the silence,
    D              Am
     I'd rather be alone
     
    Pre-Chorus:
       Am                D                  Am            D
    I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
          Am            D
    It's time I wave goodbye from the window
           G                G7                 C
    Let's end this like we should and say we're good
     
    Chorus:
    C            D               G           C
     We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
    C              D           G               C
     So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
    Am                              D
    Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
        G                    C
    As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
           C                 D                  Am  D
    Let's end this like we should and say we're good
     
    Verse 2:
                Am
    No need to hide it,
    D                Am
     Go get what you want
    D                Am          D                 Am  D
     This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge
     
    Pre-Chorus:
       Am                D                  Am            D
    I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
          Am            D
    It's time I wave goodbye from the window
           G               G7                  C
    Let's end this like we should and say we're good
     
    Chorus:
    C            D               G           C
     We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
    C              D           G               C
     So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
    Am                              D
    Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
        G                    C
    As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
           C                 D                   Am
    Let's end this like we should and say we're good
     
    Bridge:
    Am                 D               Am              D
    Now you're holding this against me, like I knew you would
         Am               D
    I'm trying my best to make this easy
        G                 G7                   C
    So don't give me that look, just say we're good
     
    Chorus:
    C            D               G           C
     We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine -Like sleeping and cocaine-
    C              D           G               C
     So let's at least agree to go our separate ways -To go our separate ways, oh-
    Am                              D
    Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
        G                    C
    As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
           C                 D                  Am
    Let's end this like we should and say we're good
     
    Outro: Am D
